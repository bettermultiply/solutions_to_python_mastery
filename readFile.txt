How to Take the Course
To take the course, you should first fork/clone the GitHub repo to your own machine.

It is assumed that you are working locally in a proper Python development environment. That means a proper installation of Python, an editor/IDE, and whatever other tools that you would normally install to work on Python. Due to the use of multiple files and module imports, the use of Notebooks is not recommended.

The PythonMastery.pdf file contains detailed presentation slides. Course exercises and suggested timings are clearly indicated. You'll want to keep this by your side (I recommend downloading and viewing it with a local PDF viewer). Start here!

The Exercises/ directory has all of the course exercises.

The Solutions/ directory has fully worked out solution code.

The Data/ directory has some datafiles used during the course.

The course was originally taught over 4-5 days in an in-person classroom setting with a mix of lecture and hands-on exercises. Successful completion of the course will likely require 30-50 hours of work. Exercises tend to build upon each other. Solutions are always provided in case you get stuck.Append
